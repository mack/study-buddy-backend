# StudyBuddy Backend
This repository was used as the backend for an iOS App developed in 2016 by [Mack Boudreau](https://github.com/mackboudreau) (myself) and Android app developed by [Ian Page](https://github.com/pageian). 
Study Buddy was a Junior Achievement Company that attempted to improve study habbits amoung students. The mobile app worked by pairing two students based on courses and allowed them to quiz each other.
The app was launched in mid November 2016 and shut down in ~April 2016.
